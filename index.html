              This Distributed AI document scanner is an attempt to improve the
              efficiency of AI scanning tools and AI response accuracy.
              <br />
              Presently, there is only so much context a single AI instance can
              intake and accurately analyze before it starts hallucinating and
              making things up.
              <br />
              This AI agent is an attempt to process larger documents with more
              accuracy by breaking the document into more manageable pieces.
              Those pieces can be fed to their own AI instance to be analyzed
              individually, thereby distributing the workload to many AI.
              <br />
              A multiple page pdf document is uploaded and each page is parsed
              out and OCR scanned to extract the text of the page. That page
              text is sent to it's own AI instance to be analyzed and a
              structured response returned. I chose the OpenAI model gpt-4o for
              this task because it was recommended over gpt-3.5-turbo. My
              thought was always to chose a cheap model for this task.
              <br />
              A vector array is created of the original page text, which is then
              saved to the vectorDB along with the structured response. OpenAI
              model text-embedding-3-small is used for this task.
              <br />
              I chose text-embedding-3-small because is creates 1536 dimensions
              by default when creating a vector and Weaviate can be set to
              expect 1536 dimensions when setting up a new collection.
              <br />
              A user can now perform RAG queries on the document using the more
              advanced OpenAI model o4-mini.

              I wanted to setup automated lead generation on my website, but I
              could only find paid plugins that would connect a form to my Brevo
              account. So I built my own instead.
              <br />
              I created React forms that can be chosen with a case/switch
              statement. The plugin's setup page is where the Brevo API key can
              be saved to the WordPress database.
              <br />
              Multiple forms can also be set up here. The desired form can be
              chosen as well as which Brevo list the contact data will be saved
              to and the CTA on the submit button can be whatever the user
              wants. A short-code is created for the form instance so it can be
              implemented on any page.
